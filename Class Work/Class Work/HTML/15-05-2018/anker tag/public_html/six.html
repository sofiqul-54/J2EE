Asia is the most populous continent, with its 4.54 billion inhabitants accounting for 60% of the world population. The world's two most populated countries, China and India, together constitute about 37% of the world's population. Africa is the second most populated continent, with around 1.28 billion people, or 16% of the world's population. Europe's 742 million people make up 10% of the world's population as of 2018, while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 651 million (9%). Northern America, primarily consisting of the United States and Canada, has a population of around 363 million (5%), and Oceania, the least-populated region, has about 41 million inhabitants (0.5%).[9] Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population, Antarctica has a small, fluctuating international population based mainly in polar science stations. This population tends to rise in the summer months and decrease significantly in winter, as visiting researchers return to their home countries.[10]</p>

        <p id="p2">"No Rest for the Wicked" is the third-season finale of The CW television series Supernatural. Written by series creator Eric Kripke and directed by Kim Manners, the episode was first broadcast in the U.S. on May 15, 2008. The narrative follows Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), brothers who hunt supernatural creatures, as they attempt to save Dean's soul from damnation. The episode marks the final appearance of Katie Cassidy as the demon Ruby. The writers initially intended that Sam would save Dean, but the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike prevented the development of that storyline throughout the season. Dean is instead killed, and sent to Hell. The episode received high ratings for the season, and garnered generally positive reviews from critics. The decision to follow through with Dean's Hell-bound contract was praised, as were the performances of Padalecki and Ackles. Sierra McCormick was noted for her "creepy" demon character Lilith.
